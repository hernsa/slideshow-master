# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest state of the `main` branch is supported. Security fixes land
there and are pushed to `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for security problems. Report privately via
GitHub's Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability" on the repo) or email
the maintainer.

## What this repo can and cannot do

This repository ships markdown instructions for agents plus small local
helper scripts — no compiled code, no network daemons, no package
installers. The attack surface is therefore small but real:

- **Prompt injection via skill content** — if a third-party fork or catalog
  entry of this skill is modified to include malicious instructions, agents
  following it could be steered to act unsafely. Vet skill sources before
  installing (see README). Report any suspicious modification of the
  official repo.
- **Malicious PRs** — all code in this repo (scripts, CI) runs in trusted
  contexts (maintainers' machines, GitHub Actions). CI runs on
  pull_request events from forks; review workflows before merging.
- **Image provenance** — decks built with this skill embed third-party
  images. `scripts/verify-images.py` enforces per-file license records;
  never merge a deck whose assets lack attribution.

## Responsible disclosure

If you find a way this skill could be weaponized to harm an agent's
operator, report it privately with a proof-of-concept. We will acknowledge
within 5 business days and track a fix.
